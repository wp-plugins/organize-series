***********UPGRADING ORGSERIES TO WORK WITH WP 2.3************************
NOTES FOR USERS
*  in order to use the series-icons functionality of this plugin it is VERY IMPORTANT that your default uploads folder  IS NOT set to organize the uploads into month and year based folders or the icons won't work correctly.

********current checklists***************
//PHP-INLINE-DOCS
...finish all the inline documentation for the plugin

//FIX ALL .CSS/LAYOUT (pretify defaults)
...also remove redundant code.
...replace all "cat" references in css and throughout default options with "series"

//BUGS
...possible bug:  add_action/add_filter for publish_posts and edit_posts isn't put in (see save_posts).  When it was activated there were duplicate series added via ajax/saving the post.  Need to see why this is and fix it.

*****************UPGRADING ORGSERIES TO UTILIZE AND WORK WITH WP 2.5*********
// SERIES REWRITE QUERYVAR
..provide an option for users to change the rewrite token for series to something other than series if they choose.

//WP VERSION CHECK
...check for which version of WP is loaded and implement updated code for WP2.5+

//WRITE-POST SCREEN
...alot of changes here - (do_action('meta-box'))
...create the new actions/filters for displaying orgSeries information.
...change series checklist so that it lists series in order of popularity?
	- new function wp_popular_series_checklist() (see wp_popular_terms_checklist()?)

//XML-RPC
...implement xml-rpc hook-ins so orgSeries stuff will be available for peeps posting from something other than WordPress.
.
//changes to manage->post and manage->series pages.

//changes to orgSeries options?

//OTHER STUFF
-- go through all template tags and make sure there is an option for executing them without pulling from the options if high traffic sites want to cut down on db queries (they'd just use the tags in their site and do all the html themselves).
-- get things looking prettier...

//SHOULD ANYTHING BE HOOKED INTO THE NEW MEDIA UPLOADER PAGE?

**************************************************
//FOR README.TXT SCREENSHOTS SECTION - WHEN THEY GET IT FIXED!
1. Number of series included on the dashboard page (WP 2.5 only)
2. New templating system on the series->options page.
3. Template system uses %tokens% making it easier than ever to customize the output of all the series information on your blog. (screenshot shown from WP 2.3.3)
4. A "Manage All Series" link in the write/edit posts screen (WP 2.5 only)
5. The "Organize Series" box in WP 2.5  It's ajaxified so you can add series on the fly AND in the right sidebar of the write/edit posts screen.
6. The "Organize Series" box in WP 2.3.3
7. The Series Filter form in WP 2.5 on the manage->posts page.  You can now filter by series in addition to the other filters!
8. The Series Filter form in WP 2.3.x - unfortunately, although you can filter posts by series, you can not combine this filter with any other filters in the 2.3 branch of WordPress.
9. The new series info column on the Manage->Posts page in WP2.5
10. The new series info column on the Mange->Posts page in WP2.3.x
11. The new Manage->Series page! (notice the series-icon integration)
12. Integrated Series-Icon (image) upload!
13. An example of the series-meta strip on post displays.
14. An example of the built-in series table of contents page (listing all the series on your blog).
